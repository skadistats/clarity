* **modifiers**: auras and effects on in-game entities
* **temporary entities**: fire-and-forget things the game server tells the client about*
* **user messages**: many different things, including spectator clicks, global chat messages, overhead events (like last-hit gold, and much more), particle systems, etc.*
* **game events**: lower-level messages like Dota TV control (directed camera commands, for example), etc.*
* **voice data**: commentary in pro matches*
* **sounds**: sounds that occur in the game*
* **overview**: end-of-game summary, including players, game winner, match id, duration, and often picks/bans
